# Weather App
A simple weather app that uses Protocol & Delegates for handling user interactions, performs network requests with URLSession, parses JSON data, and utilizes CoreLocation for location-based weather information with user Authorization.

## Features
View current weather conditions based on the user's location. Search for weather conditions in different cities. Display temperature, and other relevant data.Intuitive user interface with a clean design.

## How It Works
* The app starts by fetching the user's location using CoreLocation.

* With the obtained coordinates, the app uses URLSession to make a network request to a weather API. 

* JSON data returned from the API is parsed using Swift's Codable protocol. 

* The parsed weather data is displayed to the user, including temperature and location.
